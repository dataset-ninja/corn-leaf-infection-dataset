The **Corn Leaf Infection Dataset** is compiled from cornfields and contains images of corn leaves that have been partially affected by pests such as the Fall Armyworm. These images were captured from ground level using Samsung Galaxy J2 and Samsung Galaxy A30 smartphones, with an average image size of 3000 by 3500 pixels. The dataset comprises over 4,000 images of both infected and non-infected leaves.
